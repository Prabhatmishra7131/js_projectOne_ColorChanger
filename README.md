## This is the repo for very basic color changer JS project.
### It selects elements of class button and on registering a click event, it changes the background color of body(document) with the same color(id) as that of Target due to which event occured,
 i.e. if(e.target.id==='anyGivenColor')
 <!-- {
    body.style.bgc = e.target.id
 } -->
